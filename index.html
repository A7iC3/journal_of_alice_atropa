            Hello! My name is Sarah Alice, nice to meet you! Welcome to my
            website, I hope you have a lovely stay and a wonderful day!
          </p>

        <div class="content__info" id="home">
          <p>
            Hello! Alice here! Welcome to my dungeon— I mean website. I provide
            services related to software engineering such as website building
            and creating apps and programs.
          </p>
          <p>こんにちは！アリスです！あたしはソフトウェアエンジニアです！</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content__info" id="about">
          <h2 class="content__heading">About me</h2>
          <p>
            I am a disabled transgender woman trying to survive in this world,
            and this is my personal website! I love doing whatever I can to make
            the people around me happy, and being able to create things for
            people by doing the things I love is something I really enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am not a fan of formality; I prefer to conduct myself with people
            as I am as a person. So, while I may not necessarily be very
            "business-like," I am genuine, caring, and strive to do my best. If
            you have a vision that I can help create with you, then I would be
            thrilled to do the best I can!
          </p>
          <h2 class="content__heading">Background</h2>
          <p>
            I am an avid video game enjoyer, especially within the RPG genres. I
            have been playing video games for the vast majority of my life, and
            I deeply want to create my own one day. I especially love MMOs, as
            they really helped me socialize and make friends when I didn't have
            much opportunity to in real life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Getting to meet so many people from around the world was also a
            wonderful experience, and I made many friends in several countries.
            Some friends even with whom we didn't share a language, and I made
            the effort to reach out to help people and socialize with those who
            didn't know English by using Google Translate. The ability to play a
            game you enjoy with so many people and meet others within it was
            such a magical experience for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            That truly instilled the desire to create my own world where many
            people can adventure and explore together. It's truly a shame how
            much monetization and other less than savory practices have invaded
            the video game sphere. While I don't expect anything to come from my
            own choices alone, I at least want to give back to the community a
            world that is truly for the players—one that is purely just for
            their enjoyment and to provide that same safe, comfortable space I
            was given when I was younger.
